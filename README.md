# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-the-Office

Project Description:

This project is from @Datacamp.

In this project, I have applied the skills I learned in Python to solve a real-world data science problem. In this, I've done exploratory data analysis to analyze if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
